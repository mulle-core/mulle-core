## Linking with mulle-atinit/mulle-atexit

This library does not include [mulle-atinit](//github.com/mulle-core/mulle-atinit)
and [mulle-atexit](//github.com/mulle-core/mulle-atexit) and
[mulle-testallocator](//github.com/mulle-core/mulle-testallocator). *mulle-atinit*
and *mulle-atexit* need special linker flags and  *mulle-testallocator* depends
on *mulle-atinit* directly. As a "customer" of *mulle-atinit* or *mulle-atexit*,
that need not concern you, as the newer versions of both projects are recognizant of the fact, that mulle-core exists and that it may contain their dependencies.

### Under the hood

*mulle-atinit* needs to be linked with *mulle-thread* and *mulle-dlfcn*.
But both are part of *mulle-core*. *mulle-atinit* is and can not be part of
*mulle-core*. It needs to specify *mulle-core* as an alias preference over
*mulle-thread* and *mulle-dlfcn*. An existing *mulle-core* is now used for
linking in favor of *mulle-thread*, but *mulle-thread* is kept as a fallback.
If that wasn't done, you'd get duplicate symbol warnings from the linker.

The `mulle-sde dependency list` output of *mulle-atinit* should look like this:

```
address       supermarks     aliases                  include
-------       ----------     -------                  -------
mulle-thread  C,TreePrivate  mulle-core,mulle-thread
mulle-dlfcn   C,TreePrivate  mulle-core,mulle-dlfcn
```

*mulle-core* is now searched for in preference over *mulle-thread* and
*mulle-dlfcn*.
Because of `TreePrivate` any "benefactor" of *mulle-atinit*, will not fetch or
build *mulle-thread* or *mulle-dlfcn*.
