## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY

🚨 **CRITICAL: YOU MUST DO THIS AT THE START OF EVERY CHAT SESSION** 🚨

DO NOT skip these steps. DO NOT treat them as optional. DO NOT proceed with any
task until you have completed ALL of these commands in order:

### Step 1: REQUIRED - Enable vibecoding and read help

```bash
mulle-sde vibecoding on
mulle-sde help
```

### Step 2: REQUIRED - Read howto and api help

```bash
mulle-sde howto help
mulle-sde api help
```

### Step 3: REQUIRED - List available commands and howtos

```bash
mulle-sde commands
mulle-sde howto list
```

**REMEMBER**: `mulle-sde howto` is THE tool for getting work done in this
project. Use it FIRST before attempting any task manually.
